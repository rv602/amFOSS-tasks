# INTROSPECTION

# Why I must be chosen ?
<p>I have been doing Java since class 9th as a part of my school syllabus. But I never understood a bit of coding. I used to pretty much memorise the important programs, which obviously didnâ€™t help me in any way, and ultimately I'd fail all the Computer papers. In my 10th grade, one of my mom's close friend Mayuri mam who was a CS teacher, approached me regarding my performance in CS and assured me that she'll help me get through CS with great marks. When she started teaching me Java from the scratch, I was finally able to understand all the concepts and was able to build my own logics. From being a failure in CS, I scored a 99/100 marks in my 10th CS Board Paper. This further motivated me to continue with the CS subject in my 11th and 12th Grade as well.
<ul>Hence, I feel that if I am given a chance to be a part of the amFOSS club, then the guidance and mentorship provided will help me excel in my college and professional life as well.</ul></p>

# What is my plan for 6 months ?
<p>I have always liked and tinkered around with websites, like using the Chrome developer tools in order to get extra coins in games etc and changing the text of the elements to mess around with my friends. But as I started to explore the basics concepts of HTML and CSS, I realised how much efforts go towards creating a website, and I felt that this may be my cup of tea. Although, I later on intending to switch to Machine Learning/Computer Vision/Devops etc, I wish to stick to Web development for a while now.
<ul>Hence, my plan was to try my hands and try sharpening my Web development skills so as to get started with Open Sorce Contribution.</ul></p>

# How would I contribute back to the club?
<p>I will try to work to the extent of my limits to do what the club wants from me. Upon developing my skillset in my 1st year, I would be happy to helpout the Freshers of 2022 and onwards as a way of giving back to the club.</p>

# My feedback on the selection process
<p>I don't think I am in such a position so as to comment on the selection process of this prestigious club. But if still I were asked on a friendly opinion, I feel the process is pretty much flawless, as upon completion of the provided tasks, no one entering the club would be a complete newbie to the world pf coding / development / open source. The completion of a tasks acts as a filter to obtain only the interested and serious students and the further interview and selection process helps in getting the cream layer to the club.</p>
