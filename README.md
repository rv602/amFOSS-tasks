# My views on the task
I feel I am not in a position to comment on the tasks given as I myself havenâ€™t completed all of them. I won't say the tasks were easy but they werenâ€™t impossible as well. They acted like a bridge between doable and trickiness. Although the completion of tasks consumed a lot of time and gave a lot of headaches, it was really fun at the completion end. The best part is that we had to push ourselves above the limit and go and find resources to help ourselves instead of being spoonfed. It cultivated some self learning and awareness, atleast in my case.

# My Introduction
Hi Seniors and batchmates ðŸ‘‹ . I am Rajagopalan from Mumbai, Maharashtra. I came to know about amFOSS solely because of Quora, and I've wanted to be a part of the club since then. I feel the club will provide me structured guidance and mentoring to develop my skills and increase my knowledge. I feel I'm a rookie in coding, as I've done a bit of JAVA in my 11th and 12th Grade, but after completing the tasks, I can say I have certainly leveled up. I personally find a huge difference in myself and have gained some confidence to step into the world of coding.
