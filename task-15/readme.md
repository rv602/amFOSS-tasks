# Experience of task-15

<p>This task was one of the most challenging, brainfrying and time consuming in my experience. 
<ul>On reading the sums, they seemed quite easy but when I actually started to code it, I found my approach(s) were/was flawed as I was not able to pass all the test cases. When I thought I cracked the logic as it was working on my IDE, I started getting TLE's ðŸ¥² . So for a single qsn I had to come up with many approaches so that I can refine my further approaches. Completing this task gave me immense satisfaction and also helped me develop my optimisation skills for coding.</ul></p>
